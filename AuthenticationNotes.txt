This site will have four modes of authentication.

1) UserId and password authenticated to a filemaker account.
This works by establising a filemaker session via its dataAPI
Once the session is establised it calls filemaker with a post that includes the username and password. 
That is used in a filemaker script to authenticate the user and return a JWT.
The JWT is validated using a shared secret the user aurhorized and using IronSession a session is established.

2) A magic link containing a JWT generated by filemaker using the shared secret is received (by a page that requires authentication)
The JWT is validated using a shared secret the user aurhorized and using IronSession a session is established.
This is the route for filemaker webviewers and users accessing apps from a magic link sent by filemaker.

3) Oauth using Filemaker via its DAPI

4) Oauth from other Oauth providors
